# Text-Mining-of-Customer-Reviews-on-Masks

## Abstract
Affected by the COVID-19 situation, the sales of masks on E-Commerce online shopping platforms grow fast. In this project, we propose a 3-stage methodology framework to classify the aspects of pain points behind the customersâ€™ negative reviews on masks. First, a method based on sentiment analysis is used to separate negative and positive reviews. Then, a similarity-based method helps to cluster the negative reviews related to different aspects, namely delivery, product and service. Finally, supervised machine learning models are developed to predict the aspect labels for the negative reviews. The proposed method is found to address the multi-label classification problem well, and can easily be extended to larger datasets, other products or other industries for drawing business insights from customer reviews.
